    <title>NBC Hannibal - Quotes</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">FBI profiler Will Graham is recruited by Jack Crawford, the head of Behavioral Sciences of the FBI, to help investigate a serial killer in Minnesota. With the investigation weighing heavily on Graham, Crawford decides to have him supervised by forensic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Initially, Lecter — who is secretly a cannibalistic serial killer — works to manipulate the FBI from within, but the bond he builds with Graham begins to threaten his longevity. Lecter is fascinated by Graham's ability to empathize with psychopathic murderers and tries to push the boundaries of Graham's fragile sanity in order to turn him into a killer himself.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">That's the proposal of Hannibal, a series by NBC, based on the novels by Thomas Harris. The series is on the psychological horror-thriller, and was produced and adapted for screens by Bryan Fuller.</p>
        <p>So here are some of the best NBC Hannibal quotes and their respective scenes, in my humble opinion.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">"I was curious what would happen."</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">This scene was the very first moment Will Graham stood on the same foot as Hannibal Lecter - the first of many to come. As Hannibal said at the beginning of the scene, the fact that they are alike each other makes it so that they can manipulate and use one another. What makes this scene so special is that both are being open with their intentions, with what they want from and for each other. Not only that, but also, "I was curious what would happen" is a quote Hannibal has said more than once before - which makes Will saying it much more interesting. It shows how much they've had changed because of one another. How much they've learned.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">"Achilles wished all greeks would die so that he and Patroclus could conquer Troy alone."</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">In this scene, Hannibal compares himself and Will with Achilles and Patroclus, respectively. The parallels are made when he identifies Patroclus by his empathy, which is Will's most proeminent feature on the series. Will responds by not only accepting that comparison but, in turn, comparing Hannibal to Achilles, accepting the analogy. The key here is that the comparison can be seen as some sort of declaration of love and devotion, from Hannibal to Will. That becomes evident on the second to last quote Hannibal says: "Achilles wished all greeks would die so that he and Patroclus could conquer Troy alone."</p>

        <div class="card-group">
            <div class="card m-2 border">
                <img src="hannibal3.png" class="card-img-top">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">"Date and circunstance have returned us to this moment. When the teacup shatters."</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">For the entirety of the second season, Will has been manipulating and playing with Hannibal. Working for the FBI behind his back, as much as he was working with Hannibal behind the FBI's back. Things were getting tense, and you can feel the climax of the series aproaching - which is what happens in this scene. Hannibal discovers Will's betrayal and, in turn, hurts him back. The thing about this scene is the tenderness Hannibal expresses for Will, even as he stabs him; the heartbrokenness Hannibal shows, that contrasts with the coldness he's been showing before that. And how at that moment, and only at that moment, does Will understand just how much Hannibal cares for him. The last thing Hannibal says, before going away and leaving Will bleeding out (but not to die - Hannibal didn't want Will to die; he made sure of that), is a question that will only be answered on season 3: "I forgive you, Will. Will you forgive me?"</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">"I forgive you."</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">And here we have the answer to Hannibal's question at the end of Tome-Wan: "I forgive you." Although Will couldn't see Hannibal, or have any way of knowing he was really listening - he knew. He knew he was there. What's important, for this scene, is the context - Will is beneath the church where he saw Hannibal's heart-shapped victim, looking for Hannibal. It's the first time they interact in almost a year, and the first thing Will says when he knows Hannibal is listening is exactly that he forgives him. It's what it takes for them to see each other again, for the cycle to repeat - Hannibal has to forgive Will for his betrayal, and Will has to forgive Hannibal for his betrayal, and then they'll be able to move on. And forgive they do.</p>
